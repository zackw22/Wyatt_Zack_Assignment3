<p>I am going to continue with a similiar story from my previous week. With a variation so that can fit properly into the flow chart</p>
<p>I work for a company that has developed its own apps. Three of them to be exact. These apps require user name, account numbers and passwords.</p>
<p>I am going to try and see how I can make everything flow and make the code work properly this week</p>
